Fertilizer Recommendation System (Bootstrap UI)
📌 Project Description

The Fertilizer Recommendation System is a machine learning–based web application that recommends the most suitable fertilizer based on soil nutrient values (NPK) and soil pH.
The system helps farmers make data-driven decisions to improve crop yield and reduce excessive fertilizer usage.

The application uses a Random Forest Classifier for prediction and a Flask backend with a Bootstrap-based responsive UI.
